# One truth per fact, and a tool that enforces it

**Goal (owner, 2026-08-07):** "resolve everything and make sure everything has a state that
is the truth, and any conflictors will be removed if they are stale — but if a conflictor is
more recent than the state doc then the user will be asked."

## Why this exists

Four times in two days a fact was written down in more than one place and the copies
disagreed, silently, with a green suite:

- `tokens.json` declared paper `#FAF3DF` while `tokens.css` shipped `#FCF8EC` — and *every*
  published `onPaper` ratio in the repo had been computed against the old colour.
- `tasks/plan.md` still stated the retired "no rounded corners" rule.
- The `.oops` comment cited an exemption its own commit had retired.
- **Live right now:** `backglass/brief/render.py` sets `RADIUS_CHIP = "4px"` against a
  comment binding it to `--radius-2`, which the rescale moved to **6px**. So the morning
  brief's chips render 4px while the dashboard's render 6px. `test_brief.py` asserts
  `border-radius:{render.RADIUS_CHIP}` — the checker is keyed to the mirror, so the value
  and its test are wrong together and green together.

That last one is the whole thesis. **A checker keyed to a mirror cannot detect drift in that
mirror.** Agreement between two copies can be wrong in both at once; only a value recomputed
or re-read from its declared authority can be trusted.

## Two definitions, stated because the wording could be read literally

- **"Removed"** means *corrected to the authority's value*, not the file deleted. Taking it
  literally would delete the design-system's tables, which are the documentation.
- **"The user will be asked"** means the tool refuses to auto-fix, exits non-zero, and names
  the conflict. In an interactive session that is a question; in CI it is a failure.

## The mechanism

`scripts/truth.py` — a registry plus a checker.

Each **fact** declares one **authority** (`file` + extractor) and N **mirrors**. An extractor
returns `(value, line_number)`.

For each mirror:

| | |
|---|---|
| values agree | **OK** |
| differ, mirror's line is **older** than the authority's | **STALE** → `--fix` rewrites it |
| differ, mirror's line is **newer** | **ASK** → no auto-fix, non-zero exit |

Recency is **per line**, via `git blame -L n,n`, not file mtime — a file touched for an
unrelated reason must not read as "recent". An uncommitted mirror line counts as newest and
therefore ASKs, which is right: an uncommitted edit is fresh human intent.

**The escalation loop is the point.** If the user rules that a newer mirror is correct, the
fix is to update the *authority* and re-run — every other mirror then goes STALE and
auto-fixes. One decision propagates everywhere.

## Load-bearing constraint

**A failed extraction is a loud error, never a skip.** If a pattern stops matching because a
table was reformatted, the tool must fail rather than silently declare the fact clean. A
checker that is green while blind is worse than no checker — that is exactly how the
`onPaper` figures survived.

## Scope fences

- **Values, not prose.** Hexes, px scales, ratios extract cleanly. The exemption lists in
  `design-system.md` vs the `dashboard.css` header are prose; regex over prose is where this
  turns into a research project. Prose consistency stays with the adversarial workflow
  reviews, which have caught it twice already.
- **History is not a conflictor.** `tasks/lessons.md` and `tasks/todo.md` deliberately record
  superseded values ("4px where 6px was right"). Excluded by design, or the tool corrects its
  own history.
- **Build artifacts excluded** — the desktop bundle's frozen copies are stale until rebuilt,
  by design.
- **Seed with the burned classes only.** A fact earns registry membership by having drifted.
  Enumerating all truth in the repo up front is how this becomes shelfware.

## Steps

- [ ] 1. `scripts/truth.py`: registry, extractors, git line-recency, classify, `--fix`.
- [ ] 2. Seed the registry: paper, the five inks, neutral-500, the three radius steps, the
      border weight — across `tokens.css` (authority), `tokens.json`, `design-system.md`,
      `preview.html`, `wordmark.svg`, `render.py`, `validate-palette.mjs`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- [ ] 3. Run it on the clean tree. **It must find `RADIUS_CHIP` as STALE** — that is the
      tool's acceptance test, and it is why the fix ships *with* the tool rather than before.
- [ ] 4. `--fix` it, and fix `test_brief.py` to assert against the authority rather than the
      mirror it is supposed to be checking.
- [ ] 5. `tests/test_truth.py` so drift fails the suite like everything else.
- [ ] 6. Prove both directions by mutation: seed a stale mirror → STALE; commit a mirror
      change newer than the authority → ASK.

## Also registering, because it claims authority it does not have

`scripts/validate-palette.mjs:14` hardcodes `PAPER = '#FCF8EC'`. It is the declared source of
truth for every contrast figure, but it is itself an unregistered mirror of `tokens.css` — if
paper changes again, the validator will validate the wrong colour while claiming to be the
authority.

## Definition of done

1. `uv run pytest` green; `node scripts/validate-palette.mjs` green.
2. `uv run python scripts/truth.py` reports zero STALE and zero ASK on a clean tree.
3. `RADIUS_CHIP` agrees with `--radius-2`, and `test_brief.py` checks it against the
   authority.
4. Both classifications proved by mutation.

# Motion layer: animate every action and every page change

Written 2026-08-07. Goal: "add animations for all actions and tab changes throughout
the site."

**Assumption, stated because nothing in the markup settles it:** there are no literal
tab controls in this app. "Tab changes" means the sidebar page navigation (nine full
document loads) plus the 1–9 keyboard page switch in `base.html`. Panel-swapping
HTMX targets are "actions", not tabs. Planned on that reading; no question asked.

## What is there now

One line of motion in the whole product: `.htmx-swapping{opacity:0;transition:.08s}`
at `dashboard.css:324` — and it never plays, because htmx 2.0.4's
`defaultSwapDelay` is `0`, so the outgoing node is replaced before a transition can
run. `defaultSettleDelay` is `20`. `design-system.md` has no motion section at all.

## Shape of the work

1. **Motion tokens** in `design/tokens.css` — durations and the three strong curves,
   with one `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` block that zeroes the durations at the
   token layer instead of scattering overrides.
2. **One motion layer** appended to `dashboard.css`, single author, no per-page forks.
   Transform and opacity only (§8 rule 7 — no shadows, no gradients — extends to
   motion: things fade and slide, they never levitate).
3. **Swap animation with zero template edits** — `htmx.config.defaultSwapDelay` in
   `base.html` plus CSS on `.htmx-swapping` / `.htmx-added` / `.htmx-settling` covers
   all 94 `hx-` attributes at once. Every template edit avoided is a `panel_slice`
   test not broken.
4. **Page transitions** — `@view-transition { navigation: auto }` as progressive
   enhancement, probed in both Safari and the Tauri WKWebView rather than assumed,
   over an unconditional body fade-in baseline.
5. **§9 Motion** in `design-system.md`, with the frequency gate written down — this
   repo records its rulings there, so the section is deliverable, not garnish.

## Frequency gate (Kowalski), applied to this product

- Board Resolve/Snooze/Done and the 1–9 page keys fire tens of times a day: minimal
  or no motion. A daily action that got slower is a regression, not a polish pass.
- Panel swaps, the review queue, the failed-write strip: occasional — standard.
- Nothing here is rare enough to earn delight.

## Verification

- `uv run pytest` green (no template edits expected; prove it).
- `node scripts/validate-palette.mjs` after touching tokens.
- Adversarial CSS audit: transform/opacity only, every duration under 300ms, no
  `ease-in`, no keyframes on frequently-triggered elements, reduced-motion reaching
  every rule.
- Look at it in Safari, cache-busted, both themes (2026-08-06 lesson: a screenshot is
  a cache, not an observation).

## Motion: what the verifier caught

A fresh-context verifier refuted the first version of this. Three swap targets reached
no arrival rule — `#decisions`, `#memory` (both `.sec` sections) and `#week-grid`, the
region a checklist tick repaints out of band — and `.lnk`, which is the control the
whole roadmap surface is built from, was in no rule at all. The selector list had been
written from an id inventory, and an id inventory is a list that is correct on the day
it is written.

Fixed by selecting on `.panel`/`.sec` instead, and by adding the test that compares
every `hx-target` and `hx-swap-oob` region in the templates against the arrival rule.
Both the fix and the test were proven against a mutation: removing `.sec` lists five
regions by name.
